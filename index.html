	  <h2>Why not to hate C++</h2>
	  <h3>Tue, Jun 6 2017</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
	  I've been working seriously with C++ for about one year and
	  I would like to share my experience with one of the most important
	  programming languages of all time, also one of the most hated.
	</p>
	<p>
	  C++ is definitely hard to learn, to program and to compile. GCC sucks.
	  Seriously, don't even try to use it. Prefer clang or something else.
	</p>
	<p>
	  C++ is mind-blown. As you code in C++, your brain will suffer from
	  eternal neural injuries. You'll always be worried about
	  multi-inheritance and dangling pointers. You'll try hard to put a
	  lambda expression and face days of headache trying to understand
	  why somebody could create such a weird syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
	  However, C++ is really powerful. You can possibly do anything in C++.
	  In case you didn't know, Nietzsche was coded in C++ even having no
	  C++ at the time. See, you can't just go code something in the past
	  with Java or Python.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Imagine you have a family of rabbits. As a expert programmer with
	  years of experience in object-oriented programming, you'll define
	  a class Rabbit, and maybe a factory of rabbits if you're also
	  experienced with design patterns. But think about it a second: why
	  not inhering Rabbit from a class like Apple and Walrus, at the same
	  time? Well, you can just do this. You can do whatever you want to.
	</p>
	<p>
	  But you can also forget about all this crap of OO and migrate to
	  COBOL paradigm. Putting some goto's in the code won't hurt you,
	  you're not a coward. It will work, that's it. That is C++.
	</p>
	<p>
	  But that kind of thing you can do with any language - except for
	  Haskell, you can't do nothing but struggle with Haskell. Well,
	  let's try to cast a class to any class with horrible_cast (Google
	  is your friend). You can. Let's try to fuck up with you RAM and
	  allocate a giant elephant of dangling pointers addressing kernel
	  variables and modify everything expecting your PC to burn in hell
	  along with the last code written in Pascal: you can. You just can.
	  I just don't know why but you can, try it one of these days.
	</p>
	<p>
	  And I haven't mentioned webservers in C++. With SSL. It's insane.
	  Unit testing? Mocking framework? Setting private to public with a
	  goddamn compiler macro? Yes, you can.
	</p>
	<p>
	  That kind of power should not be hated, it must be appreciated.
	  One must take advantage of C++ power and use for the good, possibly
	  taking down advanced pseudocodes like Python and Perl. Well, the
	  latter is anything but a pseudocode. And I love Python. But I also
	  love C++, so share this love with me if you can and start writing
	  your own Makefile today.
	</p>
	<p>
	  C-x C-s.
